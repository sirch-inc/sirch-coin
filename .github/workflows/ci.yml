# A GitHub Actions workflow for CI (run tests, create preview deploys, etc.)
# This workflow runs on PRs to main and direct pushes to main (for emergency fixes).

# Although Netlify supports continuous deployment from GitHub, we use GitHub Actions here instead in 
# order to run tests before deploying, and to have more control over the build and deploy process.
# See also: https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/#continuous-deployment-with-github-actions.
#
# Additionally, at this time, Netlify (free tier) does not support deploying from private org-based repositories
# like ours, so we are using GitHub Actions for CI which skips this. We can revisit this if we move to a paid
# Netlify plan later, but some research suggests that Netlify builds can be expensive even under paid plans.
#
# We are using the Netlify CLI to deploy here, bypassing Netlify's built-in GitHub integration.
