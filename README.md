# SirchCoin Frontend Dashboard

## Overview
This is the frontend dashboard for SirchCoin, written in React/JSX and uses the `Vite.js` command-line toolchain. The SirchCoin dashboard allows users to login to their accounts, send coins, purchase coins, etc. The interface is meant to be extremely simple and mimic the actions & functionality of an ATM machine

# Developer Quickstart

## Prerequisites (one-time-chores)

1. Install the latest (long-term stable) `node.js` suite, which includes `npm`.
1. Install VS Code or an IDE of your choice.
1. Install the latest `git` tools for your platform.
1. Install whatever other `git` tools you like (`GitHub Desktop` for example).
1. After an invite by the team, configure your platform credentials to connect to the `sirch-inc` GitHub organization (which might require RSA keys, etc).
1. Configure your `git` tools to use those credentials.
1. Using your `git` tools, fetch and pull down the latest version of the `sirch-inc/sirch-coin` github repository onto your local machine.
1. In a terminal, change into the `sirch-coin` directory where you pulled/downloaded the source code, then run `code .` to open in VS Code.
1. Create an `.env.local` text file with the necessary keys (ask a developer for these). NOTE: These may change over time!

## Generating a Token for Auth

‚ùó TBD, need to test & confirm

## Building and running the latest Development build locally (day-to-day)

1. Use your `git` tools to pull down the latest code from the `sirch-coin` repo.
1. In your terminal, type `npm ci` to install a clean set of the latest dependencies (from `package-lock.json`). ON FAILURE: consult a developer.
1. Type `npm run dev` to run the project on localhost. ON FAILURE: consult a developer.
1. OPTIONAL: you can also run in other environments (test, staging, production) using `npm run <environment>`.  You will need to create appropriate `.env.<environment>.local` files.

## Previewing a Production build locally (as needed)

1. Create an `.env.production.local` text file with the necessary keys (ask a developer for these). NOTE: These may change over time!
1. Type `npm run build-production` to build the production version.
1. Type `npm run preview` to run the project on localhost. ON FAILURE: consult a developer.
1. OPTIONAL: you can also "build" for other environments (test, staging) using `npm run build-<environment>`.  You will need to create appropriate `.env.<environment>.local` files.
