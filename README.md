# Sirch Coins Front-End Dashboard

## Overview
This is the front-end single-page web app dashboard for Sirch Coins, written in React/JSX using the `Vite` (https://vite.dev/) command-line toolchain. The Sirch Coin dashboard allows users to login to their accounts, send coins, purchase coins, etc.. The interface is meant to be extremely simple and mimic the actions & functionality of an ATM machine.

### Services
Ask a developer for invites to access any of these services, if you are working in those areas:
* Auth:  SupaBase built-in authentication/authorization.
* Backend:  SupaBase is our backend-as-a-service which runs a Postgres DB and has a number of edge functions to handle front-end and webhook API requests.  Our backend repo is located here:  https://github.com/sirch-inc/sirch-coin-supabase
* Email:  SendGrid manages our email (some of which is emitted from SupaBase).  Basic plan currently owned by Jeff.
* Payments:  Stripe. Josh can provide access.
* Webhost:  Netlify. Basic plan currently owned by Jeff.
* Domain/DNS:  Godaddy (for now).  Josh can provide access if necessary.

### Hosted Environments
* [testallthethings.sirchcoin.com](https://testallthethings.sirchcoin.com) is for testing in our "dev/test" sandboxes.  Autodeploys via Netlify.
* [sirchcoin.com](https://sirchcoin.com) is our production environment.  Deployed manually in Netlify.

### CI/CD and Deployments
We use GitHub Actions for CI/CD with automated testing and quality gates, deploying to Netlify for hosting.

#### Automated CI Pipeline
Every pull request and push triggers our **high-performance parallel CI pipeline** (~60% faster than sequential):
- **Parallel Quality Checks** (Matrix Strategy): Separate status indicators running simultaneously:
  - üîç **Lint Checks** (ESLint & Prettier)
  - üìò **TypeScript Compilation** (Type checking)
  - üîí **Security Audit** (Dependency vulnerabilities & code scanning)
  - üß™ **Unit Tests** (Vitest with coverage reporting)
  - üìä **Coverage Threshold** (80% minimum line coverage)
- **Advanced Performance Features**:
  - **Enhanced Vite Caching**: Optimized caching strategy for faster subsequent runs
  - **Bundle Size Monitoring**: Automatic bundle analysis and size regression detection
  - **Lighthouse CI**: Performance testing on deployed previews
- **Non-blocking Workflow**: Preview deployments are created even if quality checks fail
- **Automated Notifications**: PR comments provide clear guidance on fixing any issues

#### Deployment Environments
- **TEST Environment**: Automatically deploys preview builds for every PR
  - URL: [testallthethings.sirchcoin.com](https://testallthethings.sirchcoin.com)
  - Triggered on changes to pull requests and main branch
- **PROD Environment**: Manual deployment only after thorough testing
  - URL: [sirchcoin.com](https://sirchcoin.com)
  - Requires manual GitHub Actions workflow trigger with confirmation

#### Quality Gates
Branch protection rules enforce quality standards:
- All status checks must pass before merge
- TypeScript compilation errors block merges
- Test coverage must meet 80% threshold
- Security vulnerabilities must be resolved
- Code style and linting rules must pass

#### Custom Deployment Environment Flags
The front-end can be configured to conditionally-compile simple, custom landing pages to inform users of system-wide modes.  We have a `Coming Soon` landing page intended for use until we launch, and a `Systems Maintenace` page intended when we need to take down the website for maintenance, major updates, problems, or abuse by hackers.  They are driven by setting one or the other following environment variables to `true` in the Netlify `Environment Variables` section (you can test these locally by adding them to your `.env.local` file):
```
VITE_IS_COMING_SOON="false"
VITE_IS_OFFLINE="false"
```

# Development Process
1. We currently use Linear (https://linear.app/) to track dev/product tasks, so download the app, get signed on (or invited), and join the "SirchCoins" team.
1. Except for micro-changes (commit directly to `main`), we generally use this process:
    1. Create a branch (from `main` or wherever).  Ideally, name it using the `Copy git branch name` from the Linear task/story you're working on, which helps correlate your changes to Linear. To get this name, open the issue in Linear then press (Command-Shift-.), or use the issue menu to `Copy git branch name`. If you are creating a branch for an untracked issue, name it `UNTRACKED: <details>`.
    1. Modify/commit your changes to your branch.
    1. Push/publish the branch to GitHub.
    1. Create a pull-request and nominate reviewer(s).
    1. (As necessary) Announce your request for review to the reviewer(s).
    1. (Iterate on changes until approved...)
    1. Merge the pull-request. Deployment to TEST is automatic on merge via Netlify, but requires manual operations to publish to PROD.
    1. Delete the GitHub branch (it can be restored later if needed).
    1. After a few minutes, verify your changes deployed to our TEST environment.  Remember to also PR/merge any dependent changes from the `sirch-coin-supabase` project if necessary.
    1. Announce to relevant testers that the changes are present in our TEST environment. Iterate on validating the changes.
    1. When ready for release:
        1. Verify with developers/testers your intention to release:  be careful here as you may be releasing OTHER changes on `main` that aren't production-ready.
        1. Consider ramifications:
            1. Does the backend need to update/migrate user records to support your changes?
            1. Do we need to reset/invalidate caches or CDN's to provide the new functionality?
            1. etc... think through the possible issues...
        1. Create a Tag/Release in GitHub for the project (usually just rev the release number).
        1. MANUALLY deploy the changes to PROD using Netlify.  See a developer for instructions.  Also remember to deploy any dependent changes from `sirch-coin-supabase` as necessary.
        1. Test the release on PROD (be careful!).
        1. Announce the release to our Slack channel, perhaps with a changelog (details to be worked out...).

# Developer Quickstart

## Prerequisites (one-time chores)

### Tools
1. Install the latest (long-term stable) `node.js` suite, which includes `npm`.
1. Install VS Code or an IDE of your choice.
1. Install the latest `git` tools for your platform.
1. Install whatever other `git` tools you like (`GitHub Desktop` for example).
1. After an invite by the team, configure your platform credentials to connect to the `sirch-inc` GitHub organization (which might require RSA keys, etc).
1. Configure your `git` tools to use those credentials.

### Set up Sirch-Coins (Front-End)
1. Pull down the latest version of the `sirch-inc/sirch-coin` github repository onto your local machine (https://github.com/sirch-inc/sirch-coin)
1. In a terminal, change into the `sirch-coin` directory where you pulled/downloaded the source code, then run `code .` to open in VS Code.
1. Create an `.env.local` text file with the necessary keys (ask a developer for these). NOTE: These may change over time!

### Set up Sirch-Coins-Supabase (back-End)
1. Pull down the latest version of the `sirch-inc/sirch-coin-supabase` github repository onto your local machine (https://github.com/sirch-inc/sirch-coin-supabase)
1. In a terminal, change into the `sirch-coin-supabase` directory where you pulled/downloaded the source code, then run `code .` to open in VS Code.
1. Follow the README there to set up your LOCAL Supabase instance to which the LOCAL Sirch Coins front-end connects in Development mode.

## Building and running the latest Development build locally (day-to-day)
1. Use your `git` tools to pull down the latest code from the `sirch-coin` repo.
1. In your terminal, type `npm ci` to install a clean set of the latest dependencies (from `package-lock.json`). ON FAILURE: consult a developer.
1. Type `npm run dev` to run the project on localhost. ON FAILURE: consult a developer.
1. OPTIONAL: you can also run in other environments (test, production) using `npm run <environment>`.  You will need to create appropriate `.env.<environment>.local` files.

## Running Tests
The project uses Vitest and React Testing Library for unit testing with comprehensive coverage reporting.

### Test Commands
1. **Run all tests once:**
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

2. **Run tests in watch mode** (tests will re-run when files change):
   ```bash
   npm run test:watch
   ```

3. **Run tests with coverage report** (CI-compatible with JUnit XML output):
   ```bash
   npm run test:coverage
   ```

4. **Run tests once without watch mode:**
   ```bash
   npm run test:run
   ```

### Coverage Requirements
- **Minimum Coverage**: 80% line coverage required
- **Coverage Reports**: Generated in `coverage/` directory with HTML and LCOV formats
- **CI Integration**: Coverage data is automatically reported in pull requests
- **Excluded Files**: Entry points (`master.tsx`), type definitions, and test files are excluded

### Test Structure
- Tests are located in `__tests__` directories next to their corresponding components
- Test files follow the naming convention `*.test.jsx`
- Each test file should test a single component or related functionality
- Tests use React Testing Library for component testing
- Async operations are handled using `act()` and proper waiting mechanisms

### Writing Tests
When writing new tests:
1. Create a `__tests__` directory next to your component if it doesn't exist
2. Create a test file with the same name as your component plus `.test.jsx`
3. Use the existing test files as examples for structure and patterns
4. Make sure to handle async operations properly using `act()`
5. Test both the happy path and edge cases

## TypeScript Support

This project is built with TypeScript for enhanced type safety and developer experience. Key TypeScript features in the project:

- Strict type checking enabled in `tsconfig.json`
- Full React component type definitions
- Type definitions for all external libraries via `@types` packages
- TypeScript configuration for both the main app (`tsconfig.json`) and Vite/Node environments (`tsconfig.node.json`)

### TypeScript Guidelines

When working with TypeScript in this project:

1. Always define proper types for component props using interfaces or type aliases
2. Use strict type checking - avoid using `any` type unless absolutely necessary
3. Take advantage of TypeScript's built-in utility types (e.g., `Partial<T>`, `Pick<T>`, `Record<K,T>`)
4. Ensure all async operations are properly typed with `Promise<T>`

### Type Checking Commands
```bash
# Check for type errors
npm run tsc

# Alternative command (same functionality)
npm run type-check
```

### Modern Build Architecture
**Type checking and building are separated** for better developer experience:
- **Type checking**: Handled separately in CI as a quality gate (`npm run tsc`)
- **Building**: Optimized Vite compilation without blocking type checks (`npm run build-*`)
- **Benefits**: Faster builds, non-blocking development, parallel CI execution

This allows developers to build and test changes even when type errors exist, while ensuring type safety is enforced at merge time through branch protection rules.

## Code Quality & CI/CD

### Quality Assurance Tools
The project includes comprehensive quality assurance:

1. **Linting & Formatting:**
   ```bash
   npm run lint  # ESLint with TypeScript support
   ```

2. **Security Scanning:**
   - Trivy vulnerability scanner for dependencies and code
   - GitHub Dependency Review for new vulnerabilities in PRs
   - Automated SARIF uploads for security issue tracking

3. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Intelligent build caching
   - Parallel test execution
   - Optimized Docker-like artifact retention

### Branch Protection & Merge Requirements
To maintain code quality, the following checks must pass before merging:
- ‚úÖ Lint Checks
- ‚úÖ TypeScript Compilation
- ‚úÖ Security Audit
- ‚úÖ Unit Tests (80% coverage minimum)
- ‚úÖ All conversations resolved

## Previewing a Production build locally (as needed)
1. Create an `.env.production.local` text file with the necessary keys (ask a developer for these). NOTE: These may change over time!
1. Type `npm run build-production` to build the production version.
1. Type `npm run preview` to run the project on localhost. ON FAILURE: consult a developer.
1. OPTIONAL: you can also "build" for other environments (test, prod) using `npm run build-<environment>`.  You will need to create appropriate `.env.<environment>.local` files.
