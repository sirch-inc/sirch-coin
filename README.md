# SirchCoin Frontend Dashboard: Quickstart

This is the frontend dashboard for SirchCoin, written in React/JSX and uses the `create-react-app` command-line toolchain. The SirchCoin dashboard allows users to login to their accounts, send coins, deposit coins, etc. The interface is meant to be extremely simple and mimic the actions & functionality of an ATM machine.

## Prerequisites (one-time-chores)

1. Install the latest (long-term stable) `node.js` suite, which includes `npm`.
2. Install the latest `git` tools for your platform.
3. Install whatever other `git` tools you like (`github` for example).
4. After an invite by the team, configure your platform credentials to connect to the `sirch` github account (which might require RSA keys, etc).
5. Configure your `git` tools to use those credentials.
6. Using your `git` tools, fetch and pull down the latest version of the `sirch-inc/sirch-coin` github repository onto your local machine.
7. In a terminal, change into the `sirch-coin` directory where you pulled/downloaded the source code, then run `code .` to open in VS Code.
8. Create an `.env` text file with the necessary keys (ask a developer for these). NOTE: These may change over time!
